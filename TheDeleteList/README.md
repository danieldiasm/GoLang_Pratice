# The Delete List

This is a program which reads a json file with a list of files in it and then reads a target folder and each file title. 
After doing so it compares which file is on the json list with those present on the target folder. In the end it tells you which files are not on the list. 

## Goal
The program should be a sort of auto-cleaner, but the real purpose is just to be a trainning field.

Here you can se JSON file marshal and unmarshal, OS interaction and stuff like this.
